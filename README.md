# MiniGhost
## project details and purpose
- building a simple 2D game with front-end and back-end with HTML, CSS and javascript and trying out new module like "phaser" (but its still vanilla Js)
## project demo (in img or vid)

## Usage and Installation
'''
git clone https://github.com/joshua-cheng2210/MiniGhost.git
cd MiniGhost
npm install
npm run dev
'''

## Packages used
- jekyll --> to host the game through git hub action
- Phaser --> a javascript game framework module to build MiniGhost
- vite --> for real time development of the game

## Topics learnt
- how framework or module works in javascript

## Mistakes made that got me debugging 24 hours
- sometimes the "dist/assets/index.js" is named as something else like "dist/assets-jnbvcfgthyj3y/index.js" with some numbers at the back, then you will have to change the package.json's run build dev command to the respective index-x500 name there too
- well this simple proj isn't too crazy compare to my very first project SnakeGame (https://github.com/joshua-cheng2210/SnakeGame)
## how to tweak this projec for your own uses (for collaborative developers)
- additional features can be added to the game
