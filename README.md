'''

## Mistakes made that got me debugging 24 hours
- well this simple proj isn't too crazy compare to my very first project SnakeGame (https://github.com/joshua-cheng2210/SnakeGame)
- well i take my words back
- sometimes the "dist/assets/index.js" is named as something else like "dist/assets-jnbvcfgthyj3y/index.js" with some numbers at the back, this is because vite this this for some reason. easy fix is to have a cite.config.js
- you didn't put "javascript-obfuscator": "^4.0.0" in your dev dependencies. the literal thing that you used to compile and bundle your project
## how to tweak this projec for your own uses (for collaborative developers)
- additional features can be added to the game
